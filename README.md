# mysql-docker
MySQL running in Docker Container with Adminer also running in Docker Container

Note that MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD is specified in an external .env file which is not part of this repository for security reasons

Also note that Docker Volumes have not yet been implemented on this instance so there is no persistence of data when container is stopped
